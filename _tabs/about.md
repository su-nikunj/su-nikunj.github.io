Welcome to DIY Dungeon, my personal blog where I share my adventures in self-hosting, tech tinkering, and exploring the latest shiny technologies that catch my eye.

I thrive on the excitement of diving into something new and figuring things out myself. Whether it’s testing cutting-edge tools, setting up servers, or tackling quirky hardware projects, I love the hands-on process of discovery. Every blog post here reflects my journey—complete with successes, challenges, and the occasional misstep that comes with learning by doing.

The name "DIY Dungeon" captures the thrill I feel when delving into the unknown. Much like an adventurer exploring a mysterious dungeon, I embark on these tech quests with curiosity and a sense of wonder, uncovering hidden gems along the way.

Through this blog, I hope to share not only my experiences but also my enthusiasm for technology. Whether you’re here to learn from my experiments, gain inspiration, or simply share in the joy of exploring the tech frontier, I hope you find something here that resonates with you.
